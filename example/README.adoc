= jQAssistant Gradle Example Project

Use this project for prototyping new functionality for the jQAssistant plugin.

Unfortunately, this project no longer reflects every change done in the parent directory.
Instead, to observer the changes made, you need to execute the `gradle publishToMavenLocal`-Task in the parent project.

== Usage

The following commands analyze the plugin itself:

----
$ cd example
$ gradlew scan analyze server
----

You should be able to go to http://localhost:7474/ and observe that jQAssistant
has applied the concept from the rules directory: the plugin class node now has
additional labels named "Gradle" and "Plugin".
